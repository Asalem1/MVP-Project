With MyList, you'll never have to make a second run to the store for that item you forgot.

Summary

MyList allows users to create shared shopping lists that updates whenever entries are added. This helps reduce confusion on what goods to get, and allows for last-minute changes without needing to call someone and have them pick up that extra thing for you. MyList helps integrate the shopping list into the 21st century.

Problem

Don't you just hate it when you come back from the store, only to realize that you've forgotten something? Or worse yet, you didn't hear your phone when your partner or friend were asking you to pick up that last minute item? With MyList, your list can be accessed from anywhere, and by whomever you chose, so whenever a change is made, you can see it on your phone and respond accordingly. Make secondary trips to the market a thing of the past.

Solution

By giving individuals access to communal shopping lists, you can simply add an item to your list and your updated list will be reflected to whoever has access to it. That way, if your friend or partner are already in the market, they can simply see the updated entry and pick it up while they're there without having to make another trip later.
